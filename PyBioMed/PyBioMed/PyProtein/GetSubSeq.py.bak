The prediction of functional sites (e.g.,methylation) of proteins usually needs to 

split the total protein into a set of segments around specific amino acid. Given a 

specific window size p, we can obtain all segments of length equal to (2*p+1) very 

easily. Note that the output of the method is a list form. You can freely use and 

distribute it. If you have any problem, you could contact with us timely.
